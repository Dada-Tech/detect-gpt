I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now that's my idea of a good diet food!<br /> by Donna Peterson", "was on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were low sugar and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Asparagus. I always buy asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good. It's the best I can recall. There's an egg on the top and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 50 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food.<unk>br />Gary Peterson"], "original_ll": -2.9976487159729004, "sampled_ll": -2.6586287021636963, "all_perturbed_sampled_ll": [-3.061594009399414, -2.8071718215942383, -2.711980104446411, -2.7150919437408447, -2.9082694053649902, -2.847228765487671, -2.885274887084961, -2.828584909439087, -2.854827642440796, -2.7691640853881836], "all_perturbed_original_ll": [-3.084300994873047, -2.9395742416381836, -3.058828115463257, -2.9367902278900146, -3.04703950881958, -3.154928684234619, -3.0960724353790283, -3.036820411682129, -3.019789457321167, -3.186927080154419], "perturbed_sampled_ll": -2.83891875743866, "perturbed_original_ll": -3.0561071157455446, "perturbed_sampled_ll_std": 0.09710390921690806, "perturbed_original_ll_std": 0.07672593574364604}, {"original": "i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does. just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience.", "sampled": "i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it is indispensable.

If you do not react to high doses of caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either.

If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ the Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects which include increased twitching, irritability, vomiting and headaches.
