The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing. These are truly great cookies.", "In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips, from the best I've ever had to big disappointments. If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products. Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors. All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.", "I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor. I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.", "I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.

He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so. It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores. So again, Amazon.com came through with a reasonable price.

I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson", "i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does. just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience.", "Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product.

Other than that we are happy :D", "I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \"spunk\" so I decided it was time to start buying him \"real\" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!", "AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.", "These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted. It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping. The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination. I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do. And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too. They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.", "I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store?", "Taste like it is stale. Will not order this again. I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it.

I always have some water handy as a chaser...which helps! I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages.

Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the \"natural\" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.

I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)", "Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.", "Even with small containers, they don't fill them up. These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?

There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor. In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale. Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream.

Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder. Now we have the Fizz...what a great product! Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz. Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango! The camelbaks always get the Fizz now. I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes.

It's very much \"an English thing\" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in \"Victoria Beckham is Marmite\" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.). Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price. Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England. The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).

He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea. We will not be buying this again. It's also super expensive.", "The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright. Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again. There is just a slight \"vitaminy\" taste, but it's not overwhelming. It's also a bit pricey for what you get.", "I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.", "Try this you might like it.

This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period.

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned. They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off. The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai. It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.

I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop.

Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT.

If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either.
