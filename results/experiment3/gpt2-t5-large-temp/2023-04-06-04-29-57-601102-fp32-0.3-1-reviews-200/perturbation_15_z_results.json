Good job, Amazon!", "The thing about Marmite is that those who don't like it hate it, and those who like it can't live without it. It's very much \"an English thing\" and the language in which we talk about it has adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in \"Victoria Beckham is Marmite\" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.). Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird British stuff available at an affordable price. Last time I ordered, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England. The process was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to ship one of the two jars to my grandmother in Japan!).
