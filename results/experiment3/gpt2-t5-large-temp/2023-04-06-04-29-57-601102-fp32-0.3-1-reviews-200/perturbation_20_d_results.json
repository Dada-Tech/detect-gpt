I'm really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that's the same for him. The taste great for me.

We have 2 dogs of our own of about 3 and 6 years respectively and one year later we noticed the size of the open gap where the bag actually fits in the dog's paw. The dog was so much smaller than he usually was. I knew it was a problem but the larger size seemed like it might be better. I would get the bag to it's logical size for a week but since they only ship 5 days it should last about 2 days. What a waste! We were going to have more dogs or cats who would just look ridiculous. I wish I could explain to them why it wasn't better when they wouldn't just see they fit where their paws were. My question for you is if it helps with bigger pets? So for dogs (5 year olds, cats, dogs, cats, puppies) if they think they get more room in their paws the bag will fill this gap.
