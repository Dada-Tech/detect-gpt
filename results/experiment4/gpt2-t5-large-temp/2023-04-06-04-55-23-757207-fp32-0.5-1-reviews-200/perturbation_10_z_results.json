It was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was a major problem. I was always excited about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the flavor of my mixed drinks and my scones. I called their hotline , and was told that they had some kind of problem with their recent sugar farm operation. They explained that their sugar mill was using an outdated machine in its processing area. They have had many problems of a similar nature. The new mill machinery, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away as soon as their grain harvest improves. The answer is that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a \"1\" and no letters. The trailing digits will be the actual date code using the Julian calendar.
