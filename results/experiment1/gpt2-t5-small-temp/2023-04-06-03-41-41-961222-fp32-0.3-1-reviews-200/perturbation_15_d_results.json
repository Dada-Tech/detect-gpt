For rides on the dirt bike , I was using my camelbak water bottle and refills with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I often got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides. Same for desert racing in the past. The camelbaks were always laced with the powder. Now we have the Fizz...what a great product, first its the best product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world 's best. First one it's a super cheap product which I use with their products. Second its convenient, handly woven into a dissovle in a fizz. Third it's great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango! The camelbaks always get the Fizz now. I also drop the powder in my mouth whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly"], "original_ll": -4.14506721496582, "sampled_ll": -2.8418684005737305, "all_perturbed_sampled_ll": [-3.0971176624298096, -3.095245122909546, -3.0048446655273438, -3.0503547191619873, -3.061448812484741, -3.2550504207611084, -3.2157018184661865, -3.1070382595062256, -3.20015811920166, -3.0791015625, -3.1537723541259766, -2.972208023071289, -3.0063467025756836, -3.2482495307922363, -3.2024919986724854], "all_perturbed_original_ll": [-4.2243523597717285, -4.258186340332031, -4.372742652893066, -4.3209228515625, -4.208292007446289, -4.277350425720215, -4.2072248458862305, -4.009709358215332, -4.2915849685668945, -4.200355529785156, -4.325899124145508, -4.177652359008789, -4.3928093910217285, -4.264477729797363, -4.086146831512451], "perturbed_sampled_ll": -3.116608651479085, "perturbed_original_ll": -4.241180451711019, "perturbed_sampled_ll_std": 0.08843822549971946, "perturbed_original_ll_std": 0.09809909904540869}, {"original": "My husband and I LOVE these chips!
