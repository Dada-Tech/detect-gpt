So I went to see Dr. Shari Shaver , who is a Board Certified Veterinary Specialist of Palm Beach County. I said I had read my description of the feline and she agreed to get it checked.

This would hopefully be a courtesy to vets who may choose to treat an older cat for the appearance of a recent kitten, and if that was an option for the other vet, then I could still try and get the pet care provider to correct the error. So I had an appointment with Dr. Shari Shaver , a Board Certified Ophthalmologist/Ophthalmologist of Palm Beach County. Dr. Shaver had read my description of the problem, and she agreed to get it checked. After I", "We have three cats: our youngest is about four-five years old, another is about thirteen, and our oldest is more ancient.

After I", "We have three cats, our youngest is about ten years old, our middle one is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.

Dr. Shaver had read a description of the kitten, and wanted me to go have eyes checked.

He was about to have it checked by another vet, but I wanted to share my experience as it would hopefully be useful to other people who may choose not to have a kitten, and if it was not an error of judgement, then I could still try and get the vet to correct the error. So I called Dr. Shari Shaver , a Board Certified vet out of Orange County. Dr. Shaver read my report, said they were very close to getting the kitten, and told us I'd have to get it checked. After I", "We have three cats. The youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well , eighty. That is what the vet told us; however, if she said that a cat may either get an adult kitten or a kitten /a litter of kittens, then I had to guess that our oldest is about seventeen years old.\n\nOne of the cats has very thin and wrinkled fur on the forehead, so the skin was not suitable for a kitten. He was about my age! So I had it checked by another vet, but I wanted to share my experience as it would be useful to other pet owners who may choose to get a kitten, or if that was an error made by the vet, then they may still try and get the vet to correct the error. So I called Dr Shaver who is a Board Certified Veterinarian of Warren County. Dr. Shaver read my description of the kitten, and she agreed to get one right away! After I", "We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is ten, which seems to be fairly ancient. That is what the vet told us; if she was correct and we were looking for a kitten or a kitten by a litter of kittens, then I would have to guess that our oldest is about seventeen years old, but the cats had thin and pale eyes and the vet said the kitten was not even a kitten. I was about to have it checked by our vet, but I wanted to share my story as it would hopefully be useful to people who may be looking to get a kitten, and if that was an error by my vet, then I could still try and get the vet to correct the error. So I called Dr. Joanne Shaver who is a Board Certified Veterinary Ophthalmologist/Ophthalmologist in Palm Beach County. Dr. Shaver had read my description of the kitten, and she agreed to get it checked. After I", "We have three cats, the youngest is eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well , that is what the vet told me.

He was able to have it checked by another vet, but I wanted to share my experience as it will hopefully be useful to other people who may choose to get a kitten, and if that was an error of the vet, I could share what I found and get the vet to correct the error. So I called Dr. Shari Shaver , a Board Certified General Practitioner of the Animal Hospital of Palm Beach County. I called her because she had read my description of the kitten, and she called me to get it checked. After I", "We have four cats, the youngest is about eleven , another is in junior high, and our oldest is, well ancient. That is what the vet told us; however, if I could have gotten a kitten or a kitten by way of kittens, then I would have been able to order another kitten; but our oldest is about seventeen years old.\n\nOne of the cats had very thin and wrinkled skin, and the vet said the skin was abnormal for a kitten. He was about to have his eyes checked by a veterinary surgeon, but I wanted to document my decision so it would hopefully be helpful to other people who may want to get a kitten, and if that was an error of the vet, then I could still try to get the vet to correct the error. So I called Dr. Shari Shaver , a Board-Certified Veterinary Ophthalmologist/Ophthalmologist of Palm Beach Gardens, FL.

After I", "We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, our second is about fifteen and our oldest is, to be honest, seventeen.

So I called Dr. Sharon Shaver, who is a Board Certified Veterinary Ophthalmologist/Ophthalmologist of Palm Beach, Florida. Before meeting her, Dr. Shaver had heard the description of the kitten, and she agreed to get it checked. After I", "We have four, the youngest one is about eleven years old, another is fifteen , and then our oldest is, well ancient. That is what the vet told me. I guess if she said a kitten or a kitten by a litter of kittens, then I would have to guess that our oldest is about seventeen years old. One of the cats had very thin and wrinkled skin, and the vet said that that kitten was not suitable for us. He was about to have a check by another vet, but I wanted to share my experience as it would hopefully be helpful to other people who want to get a kitten, and as long as I was in good hands at the house of the vet, then I could try and get another vet to correct the situation. I found Dr. Shari Shaver , a Board Certified Veterinary Ophthalmologist/Ophthalmologist of Palm Beach County. Dr. Shaver had read my story, and saw the photos of the kitten, and we agreed to get it checked. After I", "We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, our middle is around fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient. That is what the vet told us; however, he also said our cat had a problem or a condition. If our vet said we should get a litter of kittens, then I would have to guess that our oldest is about seventeen years old. One of the cats has very old and wrinkled skin, and the vet said that was not suitable for a kitten. He was about to have it checked by another vet, but I wanted to share my experience as it would hopefully be helpful to other people who may choose to get a kitten, and if that was an error by the vet, then I could still try to get the vet to correct the error. I called Dr. Shari Shaver who is a Board Certified Veterinarian and was located outside of Palm Beach County. Dr. Shaver had read my description of the kitten, and agreed to get in touch with me. After I", "We own three cats, the youngest is eleven years old, which is close to fifteen and our oldest is, a year older. That is what the vet told us; and since she said a kitten or is usually found surrounded by a litter of kittens, then I have to guess that our oldest is about seventeen ? Anyway, one of the cats has very thin and wrinkled skin, and the vet told me the skin was not suitable for a kitten. He was about to have it checked by another vet, but I wanted to share my experience because it would hopefully be helpful to other people who may choose to get a kitten, and if that was an error of the vet, then I wanted to try and get the vet to correct the error. So I called Dr Beverly Shaver who is a Board Certified Veterinary Internal Medicine Specialist from Palm Beach . Dr. Shaver read my description of the kitten, and she said she would get it checked. After I", "We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient. That is what the vet told us; however, he said a kitten or a puppy was a kitten. Based on the number of kittens, I would have to guess that our oldest is about seventeen . One of the cats has some rough and wrinkled skin, and the vet said the skin was probably normal for a kitten. He was about to have it checked by another vet, but I wanted to share my experience of this, as it would hopefully be helpful to other people who may choose to get a kitten, and if that was an error of the vet, then I could still try and get another vet to correct the issue. So I called Dr. Shari Shaver who is a Board Certified Ophthalmologist/Ophthalmologist of Palm Beach County. Dr. Shaver had seen the cat and told her of the description of the skin, and she agreed to get it checked. After I", "We have three cats, our youngest is about eleven years old, younger one is about fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient. That is what the vet told us; if she said a kitten or a kitten by a litter of kittens, then I would have to guess that our oldest is about seventeen . All of the kittens have very, very thin skin, so she decided it should be kitten skin, but the vet said the skin was not suitable for this type of cat. He was about to have it checked by another vet, but I wanted to try and document the experience as it might be useful to other people who may choose to get a kitten, and if that was an error of the vet, then I could still try and get an update from him to correct the error. So I spoke to Dr. Shari Shaver who is Board Certified Ophthalmologist/Ophthalmologist of Orange County. Dr. Shaver had found an error in the description of the kitten, but she agreed to get it checked. After I", "We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our cat is well ancient. That is what the vet told me. She said that if she said a kitten or a kitten by a litter of kittens, then we would have to guess that the oldest cat is about seventeen years of age. The kitten has very thin and wrinkled skin, and the vet said the skin was not suitable for a kitten.

So I decided to take the possibility seriously, so I called Dr. Shari Shaver who is a very respected Board Certified Veterinary Ophthalmologist/Ophthalmologist of Palm Beach County. Dr. Shaver had read my description of the kitten, and suggested to have it checked.

You'll definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 Guayaki shot but not w/ all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, etc. I can see an overdose is why you should be avoiding drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are n't safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to"], "original_ll": -3.309007406234741, "sampled_ll": -2.6124582290649414, "all_perturbed_sampled_ll": [-2.9095089435577393, -3.0380332469940186, -3.074719190597534, -2.990922689437866, -2.930946111679077, -3.054936647415161, -2.961031913757324, -3.003848075866699, -2.785160541534424, -2.8885395526885986, -3.0369584560394287, -2.978529930114746, -2.622788906097412, -3.0200889110565186, -2.8800208568573, -2.7698168754577637, -2.914659023284912, -2.9214510917663574, -2.940500497817993, -2.8843657970428467], "all_perturbed_original_ll": [-3.5334713459014893, -3.216660976409912, -3.287222385406494, -3.3873157501220703, -3.146604299545288, -3.605013132095337, -3.184736967086792, -3.257291555404663, -3.2831976413726807, -3.3128600120544434, -3.3604211807250977, -3.215545892715454, -3.5399303436279297, -3.3195438385009766, -3.3185524940490723, -3.3598239421844482, -3.126965284347534, -3.394766092300415, -3.5407800674438477, -3.505845069885254], "perturbed_sampled_ll": -2.930341362953186, "perturbed_original_ll": -3.34482741355896, "perturbed_sampled_ll_std": 0.10686805460589188, "perturbed_original_ll_std": 0.1365825507046632}, {"original": "For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.
