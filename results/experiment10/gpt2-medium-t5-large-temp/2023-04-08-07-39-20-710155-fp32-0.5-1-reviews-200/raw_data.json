I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around. The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients. The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing. These are truly great cookies.", "In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips, from the best I've ever had to big disappointments. If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products. Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors. All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.", "I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor. I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.", "I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.

I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson", "i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does. just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience.", "Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product.

Other than that we are happy :D", "I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \"spunk\" so I decided it was time to start buying him \"real\" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!", "AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.", "These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted. It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping. The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination. I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do. And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too. They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.", "I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store?", "Taste like it is stale. Will not order this again. I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it.

I always have some water handy as a chaser...which helps! I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages.

Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the \"natural\" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.

That's what I heard, at least, from an admittedly unreliable person.", "I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)", "Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it. However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.", "Even with small containers, they don't fill them up. These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?

There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor. In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale. Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories. And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I", "I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.

Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder. Now we have the Fizz...what a great product! Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz. Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango! The camelbaks always get the Fizz now. I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes.

It's very much \"an English thing\" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor (as in \"Victoria Beckham is Marmite\" meaning that those who don't like her...etc.). Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price. Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England. The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient, and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year (or would have, if I didn't decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan!).

He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea. We will not be buying this again. It's also super expensive.", "The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright. Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again. There is just a slight \"vitaminy\" taste, but it's not overwhelming. It's also a bit pricey for what you get.", "I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.", "Try this you might like it.

This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period.

The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it.

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned. They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off. The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai. It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.

I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop.

My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. You can feel good about putting this in your body! I'll be ordering again soon for sure =)", "The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I.", "Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.", "The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability. It's full, but compact.<br /><br />I haven't run out yet, and probably won't for a couple months, but I can't wait to buy it again.", "I found these new spring Pop-Tarts and bought them on a whim. My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun, colorful, amazingly detailed artwork on these Pop-Tarts. Fantastic for after school snacks, lunch boxes, and school treats. Tie with a ribbon for a bright \"thinking of you this spring\" gift. The only challenge is finding more in stores. Way to go Kellogg's - fantastic product!", "Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water. Wonderful, wonderful stuff!", "A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend.", "I was amazed at how quickly it arrived! It is a cute stocking stuffer, but only OK as far as user appeal. You get what you pay for.", "I really loved the spicy flavor these had. I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite. If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.", "I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there. He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day. Good stuff!", "Oh my gosh, is this good! Like most people, I've been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it. Then Hubby brought a jar of this home. The tomato flavor is amazing. I will never buy store ketchup every again.", "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product.

The other two that come with it are not worth your money.", "OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)", "This is the ultimate puppy food. The kibbles are great for small breeds. High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use. Less waste results from the high quality ingredients. I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions. I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods. My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com. Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock.", "Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food. They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great. They are fit and not over weight. This vendor ships extremely fast. Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!", "Hard to find the wintergreen smalls [sugar free] as stores only have the red smalls [peppermint --such a common flavor]. The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious. Driving cross country, if someone cuts me off, I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say \"Wintergreen Me!\" She pulls one out, puts it in my hand, and all is right with the world.", "Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.<br />But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat<br />very many. That makes them an indulgence that<br />rescues some people from overindulgence.", "These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips. Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it's nice to find ones that I can eat. The vinegar flavor is really intense and good.", "Product is exactly as advertised. What a savings! At least half the retail price. Easy to store because of the individual packaging.", "We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often.<br />This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.<br />Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.", "Fresh scent and taste. Easy to eat one tin in few hours. I use them as favors and everyone loved them.", "These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb.

The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters.", "This is a confection that has been around a few centuries. It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar. And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven. Not too chewy, and very flavorful. I highly recommend this yummy treat. If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.", "I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case", "I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store. One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma. So the label \"Imperial Blend\" kind of implied the herb.<br /><br />I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too. I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water. But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea.", "I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively.", "I bought these for the office and no one can put them down. I'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks. Didn't have to shop for them either, Amazon brought it to my door!", "These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant.", "Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them. They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.", "I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this", "These are healthy and my mixed Llasa, Tibetan Terrier adores them. And they are healthy and his breath doesn't smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products. A great healthy product.", "Eat at your own risk. Once I would open a bag I could not stop. Good and salty.", "This is the same food we get at pet store. But it's delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less.", "Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with.", "I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to. Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating", "we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy. doubt very much habanero is used at all. could take it up a notch or two.", "Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on.", "I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind! We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away! When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan. Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible", "Great taffy at a great price. There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy. Delivery was very quick. If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.", "I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.

My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too.", "The variety packs taste great!<br /><br />I have them every morning.

You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...", "I've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way). This is the highest price I've seen. Whole Foods carries this item and it's been on sale there for $9.99 (that's Canadian dollars, too, as I'm in Canada). It's even cheaper on Baker's Box's own website, and they're the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less. What gives? I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices.", "Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. \u00c3\u008et's a real convenience as well as a really good product. My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!", "the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores. i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for $1. dissapointing!", "Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded", "For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat. I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue. Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative. The \"zero carb\" sports drinks didn't help so what to do? One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....", "Great stuff and dependable, especially when there are a million brands \"out there\" to choose from. I love the stuff. For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California. But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again.", "I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again.", "Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!", "I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.", "The Sugar was sweet, that can not be denied. As advertised, It didn't melt when baked either. However, it will not do for your Liege Waffles/Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do. These grains are smaller, think pretzel salt, or seed pearls.", "The crust on these tarts are perfect. My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them. They are just too sour/tart for my taste. I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling. My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me.", "I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections. I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease. The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control. If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse. The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well. It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.", "we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change.

This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well.

I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food.

Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.", "I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.

Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but that's ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag it's harder to resist eating them all. This 2 oz package allows for a little \"portion control\". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!", "The BEST investment I've ever made for ginger. It's unbelievable! It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down.
