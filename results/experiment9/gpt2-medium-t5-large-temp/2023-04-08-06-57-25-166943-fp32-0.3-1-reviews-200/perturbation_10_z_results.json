Fortunately, on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now that is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"], "original_ll": -3.1058359146118164, "sampled_ll": -2.9980931282043457, "all_perturbed_sampled_ll": [-3.0312764644622803, -3.0319275856018066, -2.8793201446533203, -3.0597612857818604, -3.240065574645996, -3.0611252784729004, -3.0840346813201904, -2.973069190979004, -3.181424140930176, -2.908936023712158], "all_perturbed_original_ll": [-3.122161865234375, -3.0856127738952637, -3.1069858074188232, -3.3246991634368896, -3.183241367340088, -3.0456392765045166, -3.03082275390625, -3.2606842517852783, -3.0243005752563477, -3.3932158946990967], "perturbed_sampled_ll": -3.045094037055969, "perturbed_original_ll": -3.157736372947693, "perturbed_sampled_ll_std": 0.10495720440426401, "perturbed_original_ll_std": 0.12251402611287288}, {"original": "i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does. just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience.", "sampled": "i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it is indispensable.
