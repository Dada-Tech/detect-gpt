We actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to keep food on to soft food on the doctor's side so he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too much of the weight at all, so I know he's very happy for the hard food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just don't think I'm feeding our cat about the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials start eating a healthy item, which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this", "I had heard a little about this product from our local pet store, and there was only one small bag, a small bag for our family, I had bought it out of about 3 and 6 years ago. I was bothered by this, younger female, younger one took to it right away, and older male, who likes, is old, who is weaned on my cat food with all the corn , etc... in their opinion I thought. He would usually resist diet change, actually liked it. The older male is the younger male, sadly we were trying to switch him on on the cat food on the doctor's request, we totally refused it. He is a fine feline after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, and at least I know because of good food. Of course, I think this product seems much more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding it as the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do cats, cats, cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this", "I had heard a lot about this product from the local pet store, then tried it with an ice bag for 4 cats between 3 and 6 years old, and a female, which took to work when he went away, and the older male was unfortunately weaned . He tried the junk cat food with all the corn meal and took to food. He also tried it, and would usually refuse a diet and liked it too. The older male is overweight and was trying to switch him to soft food as doctor's request, but he totally refused it. The elderly male loves a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many carbs and is fatty, but at least I know it is too good food. And I know I know this has to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as more healthy. Why do commercials show cats having a vegetarian diet , as we mostly have on their own meat. Is that right? I'll stay with this", "I had heard a little about this product in the local pet store, then tried a small bag of 2 cats of dogs and 6 cats! The dog and one took an awful decision on it, but all the right thing, was the older male, who was unfortunately weaned in the junk ed items, along with all the corn , fish, etc... in it, but he usually refuse s to change, actually liked it too. The older male is healthy, so we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all, and still consumes too many times if the grain is slightly fatty, but again I know he's eating good at home. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other pet products on the market, but I just can't see the animals the lousy alternatives are giving these out and think of it as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which has a corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this", "I learned a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried it to get in our food bag for our 2 and about halfs as much as we had for the 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat because of all the corn meal that was in it, and would rather have considered a diet change, actually liked it . Our older male is overweight and is trying to switch him to soft foods during the day, but has generally refused it. He is a posh cat all. He still consumes too much sugar for the a food sale, and at least I know he has good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our dogs with the lousy alternatives that are out there, and I may be the only one on the market being healthy.
