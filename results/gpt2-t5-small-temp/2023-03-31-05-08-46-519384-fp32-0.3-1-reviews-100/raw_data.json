I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating.

The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination. I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do. And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too. They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.", "I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit.

Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz. Third it tastes great!

Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price. Last time I looked, it was $25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County, or about 4x what it costs in England.
